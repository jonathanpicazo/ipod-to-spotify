## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry (Python package manager)
- A Spotify account
- An iPod connected in disk mode

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jonathan/ipod-to-spotify.git
   cd ipod-to-spotify
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Set up your Spotify credentials:

   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Create a new application
   - Get your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Add `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` to your app's Redirect URIs

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Spotify credentials:
   ```
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
   ```

## Usage

1. Connect your iPod in disk mode

2. Run the transfer script:

   ```bash
   poetry run start
   ```

3. Follow the interactive prompts to:

   - Scan your iPod for music
   - Review found songs
   - Create/update a Spotify playlist

4. To clean up cache and temporary files:
   ```bash
   poetry run cleanup
   ```

## How It Works

1. **iPod Detection**: The tool automatically looks for an iPod mounted in disk mode
2. **Music Scanning**: Scans the iPod's music directory for audio files
3. **Metadata Extraction**: Reads metadata from each audio file
4. **Smart Parsing**: Handles various metadata formats and separators
5. **Spotify Matching**: Searches Spotify for matching tracks
6. **Playlist Creation**: Creates or updates a Spotify playlist with found tracks
7. **Progress Tracking**: Maintains logs of successful uploads and any issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **iPod Not Detected**:

   - Ensure iPod is connected and in disk mode
   - Try manually entering the iPod path

2. **Spotify Authentication Errors**:

   - Verify your credentials in `.env` file
   - Check that redirect URI matches your Spotify app settings

3. **Missing Metadata**:
   - The tool will skip songs with unknown artists/titles
   - Check the upload report for details on skipped songs

### Files and Caches

- `ipod_songs.json`: Cached song metadata from iPod
- `upload_results.json`: Detailed upload results and statistics
- `playlist_cache.json`: Spotify playlist information
- `.cache`: Spotify authentication cache

Use `poetry run cleanup` to remove all cache files and start fresh.

## Future Updates

   - Modern, user-friendly interface
   - Drag-and-drop functionality
   - Visual progress indicators
   - Interactive playlist management
